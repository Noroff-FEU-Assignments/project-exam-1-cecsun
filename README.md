# Project Exam 1

![image](/images/logo.png)

## Description

In this project, I was to put into practice the skills learned over my first year of studies at Noroff, and I was tasked with creating a blog site. The project includes several responsive objects on the different pages built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I used WordPress to provide an API and to add content for the blog. I built the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and fetched the data through the WordPress REST API.

## Built With

- [HTML](https://html.com/)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-cecsun.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install

### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
