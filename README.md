# Project Exam 1

![image](/images/logo.png)

## Description

In this project, I was to put into practice the skills learned over my first year of studies at Noroff, and I was tasked with creating a blog site. The project includes several responsive objects on the different pages built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I used WordPress to provide an API and to add content for the blog. I built the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and fetched the data through the WordPress REST API.
